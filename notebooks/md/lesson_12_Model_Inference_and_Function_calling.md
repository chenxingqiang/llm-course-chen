### 4.5.4 Reflection

Implementing custom function calling mechanisms greatly expands the capabilities of LLMs, allowing them to interact with external systems and perform real-world tasks. This bridges the gap between language understanding and practical application.

Consider the following questions:

1. How does the implementation of custom function calling change the way we interact with and utilize LLMs?
2. What are the potential security and privacy concerns when allowing an AI to execute functions, and how can these be addressed?
3. How might you extend this system to handle more complex tasks or integrate with a wider range of external services?
