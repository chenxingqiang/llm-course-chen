    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a master chef preparing a complex dish. Before you start cooking, you need to slice, dice, and prepare all your ingredients. That's what tokenization does for language models – it breaks down the raw text into bite-sized pieces that the model can digest.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's look at some popular subword tokenization algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**: The OG of subword tokenization. It starts with characters and merges the most frequent pairs. It's like making a word smoothie!\n",
    "- **WordPiece**: Google's secret recipe. It's similar to BPE but uses a likelihood criterion for merging. Fancy, huh?\n",
    "- **SentencePiece**: The Swiss Army knife of tokenization. It can handle any language without pre-tokenization. It's the polyglot of the tokenization world!\n",

    "Reward modeling and reinforcement learning are crucial for creating LLMs that are not just capable, but also aligned with human values. They allow us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Teach our models to prefer outputs that are helpful, truthful, and ethical.\n",
    "2. Continuously improve our models based on human feedback.\n",
    "3. Mitigate some of the risks associated with deploying powerful AI systems.\n",

    "# Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Custom Multilingual Tokenizer:**\n",
    "   Implement a custom tokenizer that can handle multiple languages (e.g., English, Mandarin, Arabic) and compare its performance with standard tokenizers from libraries like HuggingFace Tokenizers. Evaluate on metrics such as vocabulary size, out-of-vocabulary rate, and tokenization speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Prompting for Complex Reasoning:**\n",
    "   Design and implement an advanced prompting strategy for multi-step mathematical problem-solving. Use techniques like chain-of-thought prompting or self-consistency. Compare its performance with standard prompting on a dataset of complex math problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comprehensive Data Preparation Pipeline:**\n",
    "   Develop a data preparation pipeline that includes advanced cleaning (e.g., named entity anonymization), augmentation (e.g., back-translation), and bias mitigation techniques. Apply this pipeline to a real-world dataset like Civil Comments and analyze its impact on model performance and fairness metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Curriculum Learning for Pre-training:**\n",
    "   Implement a pre-training methodology that incorporates curriculum learning for a small language model. Start with simple language modeling tasks and progressively increase difficulty. Evaluate its effectiveness compared to standard pre-training on perplexity and downstream task performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning:**\n",

    "\n",
    "6. **Reward Modeling and RL Fine-Tuning:**\n",

    "7. **Quantization Strategy Comparison:**\n",
    "   Implement and compare different quantization strategies (e.g., post-training quantization, quantization-aware training, and mixed-precision quantization) for a pre-trained language model. Analyze the trade-offs between model size, inference speed, and performance on a benchmark dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Comprehensive Evaluation Framework:**\n",
    "   Design a comprehensive evaluation framework for a multi-task language model. Include metrics for performance (e.g., accuracy, F1 score), robustness (e.g., adversarial examples), fairness (e.g., demographic parity), and safety (e.g., toxicity detection). Apply this framework to evaluate a real model like BERT or RoBERTa and present your findings.\n",
