    "# 6. Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Design a set of prompts for a virtual assistant that can help users with personal finance management. Include prompts for budgeting advice, investment suggestions, and debt management strategies. Implement these prompts using the OpenAI API and evaluate their effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Develop a prompt chaining system for a complex task, such as analyzing a scientific paper. Create a series of prompts that guide the AI through steps like summarizing the abstract, identifying key findings, and generating follow-up research questions. Test your system on at least three different scientific papers and report on its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Conduct a bias analysis on a set of prompts designed for a job interview chatbot. Identify potential sources of bias in the prompts and propose modifications to mitigate these biases. Implement your changes and compare the outputs of the original and modified prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a prompt optimization framework that uses A/B testing to improve prompt performance over time. Implement this framework for a specific application (e.g., a customer support chatbot) and run a series of tests to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving response quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a 2000-word essay on the ethical implications of advanced prompt engineering. Discuss potential risks, such as manipulation of AI outputs, and propose guidelines for responsible prompt engineering practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Develop a comprehensive evaluation rubric for assessing the quality of AI-generated responses in an educational context. Use this rubric to evaluate a set of prompts designed for explaining complex scientific concepts to students at different educational levels.\n",
