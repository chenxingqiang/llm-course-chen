    "#### 4.2.2 Case Study: Multilingual Customer Support System\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine developing a multilingual customer support system for a global e-commerce platform. This system would incorporate multiple NLP tasks:\n",
    "\n",

    "3. Named Entity Recognition (Extraction): Identify product names, order numbers, or customer names in the query.\n",
    "4. Sentiment Analysis (Classification): Gauge the customer's mood from their message.\n",
    "5. Machine Translation (Generation): Translate the customer's message if it's not in the support agent's language.\n",
    "6. Response Generation (Generation): Automatically generate appropriate responses based on the query's intent and extracted information.\n",

    "The field of NLP has seen significant advancements over the years, evolving from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated neural network-based approaches. This evolution can be broadly categorized into several stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rule-based Systems (1950s-1980s): Hand-crafted rules for language processing.\n",

    "   - Cons: Struggled with exceptions and idioms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Statistical MT (e.g., Google Translate, 2000s): Used statistical models trained on parallel corpora.\n",
    "   - Pros: Better handling of language variations.\n",
    "   - Cons: Required large parallel corpora, struggled with long-range dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Neural MT (e.g., Google's GNMT, 2016): Used sequence-to-sequence models with attention.\n",
    "   - Pros: Significant improvement in fluency and accuracy.\n",
    "   - Cons: Computationally intensive, potential for hallucination.\n",

    "## 6. Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a text classification system using three different approaches: a traditional machine learning method (e.g., Naive Bayes or SVM), a recurrent neural network (LSTM or GRU), and a fine-tuned BERT model. Compare their performance on a dataset of your choice (e.g., movie reviews, news articles).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Develop a named entity recognition (NER) system using spaCy. Train it on a custom dataset related to a specific domain (e.g., medical texts, legal documents) and evaluate its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Experiment with the GPT-2 model (or GPT-3 if you have access) to generate text in different styles (e.g., news articles, poetry, technical documentation). Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the generated text and discuss potential applications and ethical considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implement a simple chatbot using a combination of rule-based and machine learning techniques. The chatbot should be able to handle basic queries in a specific domain (e.g., customer support for an e-commerce platform).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Conduct a literature review on recent advancements in multilingual NLP models. Write a report (1500-2000 words) discussing the challenges in multilingual NLP and how recent models address these challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Develop a simple machine translation system using sequence-to-sequence learning with attention. Train it on a small parallel corpus (e.g., English-French) and compare its performance with popular online translation services.\n",
