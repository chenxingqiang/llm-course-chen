    "## Lesson Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Understand the importance of prompts in AI interactions\n",
    "2. Write effective prompts for various use cases\n",
    "3. Apply prompt optimization techniques\n",
    "4. Implement advanced prompting strategies like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought\n",
    "5. Recognize and prevent prompt injection attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Theory (25 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction to ChatGPT Prompts (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "A prompt is the input we give to ChatGPT to elicit a desired response. It's crucial because:\n",
    "- It sets the context for the AI's response\n",
    "- It determines the quality and relevance of the output\n",
    "- It can guide the AI to perform specific tasks or adopt particular roles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Writing Effective Prompts (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key principles for writing good prompts:\n",
    "- Be clear and specific\n",
    "- Provide context\n",
    "- Use examples when necessary\n",
    "- Break complex tasks into steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Prompt Optimization (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Techniques to improve prompt effectiveness:\n",
    "- Iterative refinement\n",
    "- A/B testing different prompt structures\n",
    "- Using system messages to set behavior\n",
    "- Incorporating few-shot learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world use case: AI Customer Service\n",
    "- Setting the AI's role and tone\n",
    "- Providing company-specific information\n",
    "- Handling common customer queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Chain of Thought Prompting (3 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encourages the model to break down complex problems into steps\n",
    "- Improves reasoning and problem-solving capabilities\n",
    "- Useful for math problems, logical reasoning, and complex analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Self-Consistency (3 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate multiple responses to the same prompt\n",
    "- Aggregate results to improve accuracy\n",
    "- Particularly effective for tasks with a clear correct answer\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Tree of Thought (3 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extends Chain of Thought by exploring multiple reasoning paths\n",
    "- Allows for backtracking and choosing the most promising path\n",
    "- Useful for complex problem-solving tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Preventing Prompt Injection Attacks (1 minute)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be aware of potential security risks in user-provided inputs\n",
    "- Implement input sanitization\n",
    "- Use role-playing prompts to maintain AI behavior\n",
    "- Regular testing and monitoring of AI responses\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Practice (25 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put our theory into practice with hands-on examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Basic Prompt Writing (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Task: Write a prompt for ChatGPT to explain quantum computing to a 10-year-old.\n",
