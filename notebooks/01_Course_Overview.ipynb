    "## 1. What is AGI?\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work. Unlike narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, AGI aims to possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of domains, similar to human intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of AGI include:\n",
    "- Generalization: The ability to apply knowledge to new, unseen situations\n",
    "- Learning: Continuous adaptation and improvement based on new information\n",
    "- Reasoning: Logical thinking and problem-solving across diverse domains\n",
    "- Creativity: Generation of novel ideas and solutions\n",
