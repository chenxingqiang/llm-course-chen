    "This comprehensive mind map provides a visual overview of the key concepts covered in this lessonThis comprehensive mind map provides a visual overview of the key concepts covered in this lesson, illustrating the interconnections between AGI, skills for the AGI era, LLMs, ethical considerations, and our course structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.3 Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "In our next lesson, we will delve into the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP), laying the groundwork for our exploration of Large Language Models. We'll cover key concepts such as tokenization, word embeddings, and basic neural network architectures for NLP tasks. This foundation will be crucial for understanding the more advanced topics we'll encounter in subsequent lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Research and write a 1000-word essay on a recent advancement in LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, BERT, T5) and its potential impact on AGI development. Include a discussion of both technical achievements and ethical considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Conduct a self-assessment of your current skills based on the AGI era skill sets discussed in this lesson. Create a personal development plan outlining areas for improvement and specific actions you can take to enhance your skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implement the `SimulatedAGI` class from the code example in section 4.1.3. Extend it with at least two new methods that demonstrate additional AGI-like capabilities (e.g., learning from mistakes, combining knowledge from multiple domains). Provide examples of how these new capabilities work.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using the OpenAI API (or a similar service if you have access), create a Python script that demonstrates the few-shot learning capabilities of a large language model. Choose a task (e.g., sentiment analysis, named entity recognition) and show how the model performs with varying numbers of examples (0, 1, and 3 shots).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Design a simple ethical framework for AGI development, considering the points discussed in section 4.4. Create a flowchart or decision tree that an AI development team could use to evaluate the ethical implications of their work at different stages of the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explore the concept of \"AI alignment\" by reading Nick Bostrom's paper \"The Superintelligent Will: Motivation and Instrumental Rationality in Advanced Artificial Agents\" (or a similar introductory text on AI alignment). Write a 500-word summary of the key challenges in aligning AGI systems with human values and potential approaches to addressing these challenges.\n",
