    "Before we delve into specific tasks, let's take a moment to understand the big picture. NLP tasks can be broadly categorized into three main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classification Tasks**: These are all about putting text into predefined categories. Think of it as sorting your laundry – you're deciding which pile each item belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extraction Tasks**: Here, we're playing detective, hunting for specific pieces of information within text. It's like finding all the red jellybeans in a jar of mixed flavors.\n",

    "###  Future Directions in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "As we look to the future, several exciting trends are emerging in NLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multimodal Learning**: Future NLP models may not be limited to text alone. We're seeing increasing interest in models that can process and generate multiple types of data, including text, images, and audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning**: Models that can learn new tasks with minimal examples are becoming increasingly powerful. This could lead to more adaptable and generalizable AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Smaller, More Efficient Models**: While the trend has been towards larger models, there's also research into creating smaller, more efficient models that can run on edge devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multilingual and Cross-lingual Models**: As global communication increases, we're likely to see more powerful models that can work across multiple languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ethical and Responsible AI**: There will be an increased focus on developing NLP systems that are fair, transparent, and respect user privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Domain-Specific Applications**: We'll likely see more specialized NLP models tailored for specific industries like healthcare, finance, and legal.\n",
    "\n",
